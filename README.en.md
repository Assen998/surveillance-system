## ✨ Features

### 🎥 Camera Access (Two Connection Modes)
- **ONVIF auto-discovery (recommended)**: enter IP/credentials → discover the device → fetch Profiles & RTSP stream URL → preview/record
- **Direct RTSP URL**: paste any playable full RTSP URL (with credentials), no ONVIF needed; connectivity is ffprobe-tested before saving
- The connection mode is fixed at creation time and locked during editing (prevents cross-contamination of the two connection field sets)
- ONVIF device discovery, LAN WS-Discovery probe, camera start/stop/restart, online status monitoring
- Live preview (low-latency HLS), PTZ control (ONVIF), manual snapshots
- Preview source selection: main stream (HD) / sub stream (low resolution, saves bandwidth/CPU, recommended for multi-view)

### 🎬 Recording & Playback
- Recording policies: continuous, motion-triggered (ONVIF cameras only), schedule-based
- Segment storage (default 3 min/segment, configurable), automatic indexing, fast seeking
- Historical playback (HLS), segment download, snapshot management (global browse, filter, one-click clear)

### 🔔 Alert Push
- **ONVIF event-driven motion detection**: camera hardware reports motion → alert generated → recording auto-triggered
  - 60 s recording, 60 s cooldown (`camera.motion_record` configurable)
- Tiered alerts (low/medium/high/critical), deduplication & cooldown
- Multi-channel push: Webhook (DingTalk/Feishu/WeCom/Gotify), Email (SMTP), SMS

### 💾 Storage Management
- **Local storage**: disk monitoring, automatic cleanup by retention days / capacity limit
- **WebDAV**: remote archiving with independent retention; "WebDAV-only" mode (delete local copy after upload; local is just a temporary buffer)
- **MinIO / S3 object storage**: remote archiving, independent retention, optional "MinIO-only" mode
- Playback auto-fallback: when the local file is missing, stream from WebDAV / MinIO (Range seeking supported)
- Storage usage statistics, manual cleanup

### 🛡 Security & Operations
- **First-run wizard**: fresh installs ship with no default account; the browser opens an environment check, then you create the admin account
- **Environment check**: ffmpeg/ffprobe presence, writable database/recording/log directories, disk space, WebDAV/MinIO connectivity — each failed item includes concrete fix commands; also available anytime under System Settings → Maintenance
- RBAC with three roles: admin / operator / read-only; JWT authentication
- Database backup/restore, log viewer/clear, self-update (pulls from GitHub Releases)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

| Dependency | Requirement | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| FFmpeg | `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` in PATH | Used for streaming/preview/recording/probing — **the only required dependency** |
| Others | none | SQLite is a pure-Go built-in driver; no CGO, no database service |

Install FFmpeg:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu / Armbian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg

# RHEL / CentOS / Fedora
sudo dnf install -y ffmpeg
```

> If FFmpeg is missing or directories are not writable, the server still starts — the first-run setup page and "Maintenance → Environment Check" will list the missing items with exact fix commands.

### Option 1: systemd One-Click Install (recommended for Linux servers)

Clone the repository and run the installer (**the script first asks you to choose 简体中文 / English**):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Assen998/surveillance-system.git
cd surveillance-system
sudo bash deployments/deploy.sh        # auto-downloads the latest release asset for your platform
# Install a local binary instead:
sudo bash deployments/deploy.sh /path/to/surveillance-server
# Uninstall (data is kept; remove /opt/surveillance manually to wipe it):
sudo bash deployments/deploy.sh --uninstall
```

- Auto-detects the architecture (amd64 / arm64 / armv7) and downloads the matching latest-release asset
- **Custom ports on first install**: the script prompts for the HTTP port (default `8080`) and WebSocket port (default `8081`), validates them (range + not already in use) and writes them into the generated `config.yaml`; with an existing config it asks nothing and changes nothing
- Installs to `/opt/surveillance`; generates `config.yaml` on first install — **an existing config is always preserved, never overwritten**
- Creates the `surveillance` systemd service: starts on boot, auto-restarts on crash
- If GitHub is not reachable directly, download via a proxy: `http_proxy=... https_proxy=... sudo bash deployments/deploy.sh`
- Non-interactive (piped/CI) runs auto-detect the system locale; force a language with `DEPLOY_LANG=zh|en`; ports can be set with `SURVEILLANCE_HTTP_PORT` / `SURVEILLANCE_WS_PORT`

### Option 2: Download a Release (no build needed)

Grab the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Assen998/surveillance-system/releases) (e.g. `surveillance-system-1.5.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz`). It extracts to a **version-less stable directory** (e.g. `surveillance-system-linux-arm64/`):

```
surveillance-server         # single binary (frontend embedded)
config.yaml                 # default configuration
README.md
```

```bash
cd surveillance-system-linux-arm64
./surveillance-server        # auto-loads config.yaml in the same directory
```

### Option 3: Build from Source

The frontend build is embedded into the backend binary via Go's `go:embed`, producing a **single executable**:

```bash
cd surveillance-system

# 1) Build the frontend first (generates web/dist for go:embed)
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# 2) Build the backend (embeds the frontend → single binary)
go build -o surveillance-server ./cmd/server
```

Cross-compilation (zero CGO, fully static; linux/windows/darwin × amd64/arm64, etc.):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o surveillance-server ./cmd/server
```

### First Run (important)

```bash
./surveillance-server
```

Open `http://<server-ip>:8080` in the browser:

1. **Environment check**: the page automatically checks ffmpeg/ffprobe, directory permissions, disk space, and connectivity of enabled storage services;
   failed items show exact fix commands (e.g. `sudo apt install -y ffmpeg`). **You cannot continue while a critical check fails** — fix it and click "Re-check"
2. **Create the admin account**: set a username/password (min 6 characters), then click "Finish setup and enter the system"
3. After setup you land on the dashboard; **the setup page is no longer accessible** (the backend endpoints are disabled at the same time)

> Fresh installs have no default account at all; upgrading an existing database skips the setup and logs in as usual.

- Web UI: `http://localhost:8080`
- Health check: `GET http://localhost:8080/health`

### Upgrading

The directory name carries no version, so upgrading is just **extract the new archive over the same directory**:

```bash
cd /root    # assuming deployment is /root/surveillance-system-linux-arm64
cp surveillance-system-linux-arm64/config.yaml /tmp/config.yaml.bak   # ① back up your config
tar xzf ~/surveillance-system-1.5.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz                # ② extract over it
cp /tmp/config.yaml.bak surveillance-system-linux-arm64/config.yaml   # ③ restore config
systemctl restart surveillance-server   # ④ restart (or relaunch ./surveillance-server)
```

- `data/` (database) and `recordings/` (recordings) are **not in the archive** — extracting over keeps them automatically
- `config.yaml` is in the archive and gets reset to defaults on extraction → restore per ①③ (or re-save settings in the web UI after upgrading)
- No changes needed for systemd units or autostart references
- You can also use **self-update** in "System Settings → Maintenance" (pulls from GitHub Releases)

## 📡 Camera Access Guide

### ONVIF Auto-Discovery (recommended)

For ONVIF-capable cameras (Hikvision, Dahua, TP-Link and other mainstream brands):

1. Cameras → Add Camera → choose "ONVIF Auto-Discovery"
2. Enter IP/username/password, click "Auto-detect & fill"
3. The system fetches device info, Profiles (main/sub stream) and the RTSP URL; pick a Profile and save
4. Streaming starts automatically; the ONVIF event subscription is established too (motion alerts become available)

### Direct RTSP URL

For: cameras without ONVIF, difficult ONVIF setups, or a known-good RTSP URL (NVR re-streams, forwards from other devices, etc.):

1. Cameras → Add Camera → choose "RTSP Stream URL"
2. Enter a name and paste a **playable full RTSP URL** (with credentials), e.g. Hikvision main stream:
   ```
   rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.64:554/Streaming/Channels/101?transportmode=unicast
   ```
   Use `102` instead of `101` for the sub stream; for streams without credentials just use `rtsp://IP:port/path`
3. On save the backend runs an ffprobe connectivity test — a failing stream is rejected with a clear error and never stored
4. Note: RTSP-direct cameras have **no ONVIF event reporting**, so only "continuous"/"schedule" recording types are offered; PTZ is also unavailable (requires ONVIF)

### Editing Cameras

- The connection mode is fixed at creation and locked when editing (to change it, delete and re-add)
- ONVIF cameras can be re-probed to refresh Profiles; RTSP cameras can change their stream URL (password is never shown — leave it unchanged to keep the original credentials)

---

## 🎬 Recording Types

| Type | Description | Applies to |
|------|------|------|
| Continuous | 24/7 resident recording stream, cut into segments | all cameras |
| Motion-triggered | no resident stream; records 60 s only when an ONVIF event fires (60 s cooldown) | **ONVIF cameras only** |
| Schedule | records within hour ranges (e.g. `9-18,22-6`) | all cameras |

---

## 💾 Storage Modes

| Mode | Local | Remote (WebDAV/MinIO) | Use case |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Local only | store + auto-cleanup | — | single-node deployment |
| Local + remote archive | store + auto-cleanup | archived with independent cleanup | fast local + long-term remote |
| Remote only (`only: true`) | temporary buffer before upload, deleted after successful upload | primary storage | small local disk, remote-first |

- In "remote-only" mode, old recordings auto-play from the remote store (Range seeking supported)
- WebDAV and MinIO can be enabled simultaneously without conflict (the same recording is archived to both)

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Deployment files live in `deployments/`. Besides the main app, MinIO (object storage) and Nginx (HTTPS reverse proxy) are optional, enabled via compose profiles:

```bash
cd deployments
docker compose up -d                          # main app only
docker compose --profile minio up -d          # + MinIO (9000 API / 9001 console)
docker compose --profile nginx up -d          # + Nginx (prepare deployments/ssl/ certs first)
```

Data is persisted in the named volumes `surveillance-data` / `surveillance-recordings` / `surveillance-logs`, mounted at `/app/data`, `/app/recordings`, `/app/logs` inside the container.

> The system runs out of the box without Redis / PostgreSQL (pure-Go SQLite driver); MinIO is only needed when object storage is configured.

### Key Flows

- **Motion-triggered recording**: camera reports motion via ONVIF events → `onvifevent` creates an alert → `TriggerMotionRecording` records per `camera.motion_record` and enters cooldown
- **Recording archiving**: segment finished → local write → parallel upload to WebDAV/MinIO (3 retries) → `only` mode deletes the local copy → `storage_path` written back
- **Playback fallback**: file request → serve from local if present → else WebDAV → else MinIO (all support Range)
- **First-run setup**: at startup, detect whether the DB file was just created (`FirstRun`) → skip the default admin seed → frontend `/setup` page runs the environment check + creates the admin → endpoints disabled after `POST /setup`

### Adding a New Module

1. Create a module directory under `internal/`
2. Implement `Start()` / `Stop()` lifecycle methods
3. Register and start it in `cmd/server/main.go`
4. Add routes in `internal/api/server.go`
5. Add the corresponding frontend page and API calls

## 🔍 FAQ

### First-run setup reports environment check failures
- Every failed check carries a concrete fix command; common ones:
  - missing `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg` (Debian/Armbian) or `sudo dnf install -y ffmpeg`
  - directory not writable: `sudo chown -R <service-user> <dir>`
  - low disk space: check with `df -h`, clean up or expand
- Click "Re-check" after fixing; "System Settings → Maintenance → Environment Check" is available anytime

### Camera shows offline / connection failed
1. Check network connectivity: `ping <camera_ip>`, ensure the RTSP port (usually 554) is reachable
2. Verify the RTSP URL plays in VLC
3. Ensure the camera encoding is H.264 / H.265
4. Check the server log (Maintenance → Logs) for the exact error

### Video won't play / stuttering
1. Ensure FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
2. For multi-view / low-bandwidth: set `camera.preview_stream` to `sub` (sub stream; recommended on ARM devices)
3. Tune `storage.local.segment_duration` and the HLS segment length
4. Check whether disk write speed is the bottleneck

### Motion-triggered recording never fires
- Motion detection is **only available for ONVIF cameras** (it relies on ONVIF event reporting); RTSP-direct cameras don't offer this option
- Verify:
  1. the camera is connected via ONVIF and supports ONVIF events (Analytics / MotionDetection)
  2. `camera.onvif_event.enabled` is `true`
  3. the recording type is set to "Motion-triggered"

### Low disk space
1. **Enable "WebDAV-only / MinIO-only" mode** (System Settings → Storage): the local copy is deleted after a successful upload; local keeps only the pre-upload buffer; old recordings auto-play from the remote store
2. Reduce `max_days` or increase the cleanup frequency
3. Set a `max_storage_gb` capacity limit
4. Archive to WebDAV / MinIO to offload
5. Trigger cleanup manually: `POST /api/v1/storage/cleanup`

### Forgot the admin password
- There is no online reset. If you have a database backup, restore it; otherwise delete `data/surveillance.db` and re-initialize (**this loses all camera/recording index settings**), then go through first-run setup again.
